#ABSTRACT hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia a 5-year prospective study medicosocial studies of hemophilia are of particular clinical importance in allowing an assessment of the likely course of the disease at different ages and for differing grades of severity and in providing knowledge of which complications cause the most disability loss of education and earning capacity they also overcome the distorted clinical impression of the disease which arises from the recurrent admission of the same few severely affected hemophiliacs owing to the considerable individual variation in the number and severity of complications in different hemophiliacs an accurate individual prognosis can never be given in general however the number of spontaneous episodes per year decreases with age while the severity of individual episodes tends to increase at least until the age of 21 yr there is general agreement that the bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are due to hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathy involves the knee more than it does any other joint the increased time spent in hospital per episode in later life is in part at least due to the development of relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due to hemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy thus the correct management of individual hemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance and at the present time too little is known of the best possible treatment for these episodes little is known of the pathological mechanisms of hemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presence of blood or its presence under tension which leads to joint destruction thus opinions differ concerning the routine admission of all hemarthroses to hospital regardless of severity and also about the advisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoid the development of destructive arthropathy because of the individual variation between patients the changes in the pattern of the disease with age and the difficulty of obtaining suitable control patients these questions can be answered only by further longterm prospective medicosocial studies
