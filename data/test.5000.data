#ABSTRACT Datalink layer framing wireless sensor networks faces trade-off large frame sizes high channel bandwidth utilization small frame sizes effective error recovery. high error rates intermote communications, TinyOS opts favor small frame sizes cost extremely low channel bandwidth utilization. paper, describe Seda: streaming datalink layer resolves dilemma decoupling framing error recovery. Seda treats packets upper layer continuous stream bytes. breaks data stream blocks, retransmits erroneous blocks (as opposed entire erroneous frame). Consequently, frame-error-rate (FER), main factor bounds frame size current design, irrelevant error recovery. frame sufficiently large great favor high utilization wireless channel bandwidth, compromising effectiveness error recovery. Meanwhile, size block configured error characteristics wireless channel optimize performance error recovery. Seda implemented datalink layer TinyOS, evaluated simulations experiments testbed 48 MicaZ motes. results show that, increasing TinyOS frame size default 29 bytes 100 bytes (limited buffer space MicaZ firmware), Seda improves throughput 25% typical wireless channel conditions.

#ABSTRACT Context: Early detection non-functional requirements (NFRs) crucial evaluation architectural alternatives starting initial design decisions. application supervised text categorization strategies requirements expressed natural language proposed works method analysts detection classification NFRs aspects software. However, significant number pre-categorized requirements needed train supervised text classifiers, implies analysts manually assign categories numerous requirements accurately classifying remaining ones. Objective: propose semi-supervised text categorization approach automatic identification classification non-functional requirements. Therefore, small number requirements, possibly identified requirement team elicitation process, enable learning initial classifier NFRs, successively identify type requirements iterative process. goal approach integration recommender system assist requirement analysts software designers architectural design process. Method: Detection classification NFRs performed semi-supervised learning techniques. Classification based reduced number categorized requirements taking advantage knowledge provided uncategorized ones, properties text. learning method exploits feedback users enhance classification performance. Results: semi-supervised approach resulted accuracy rates 70%, considerably higher results obtained supervised methods standard collections documents. Conclusion: Empirical evidence showed semi-supervision requires human effort labeling requirements fully supervised methods, improved based feedback provided analysts. approach outperforms previous supervised classification proposals enhanced exploiting feedback provided analysts.

Modeling traffic packet level difficult, traffic link result high level multiplexing numerous flows behavior strongly influenced transport protocol application. flow model generic notion.

Non-synonymously redundant representations genetic operators work properly result lower performance evolutionary search. synonymously redundant representations, performance selectorecombinative genetic algorithms (GAs) depends modification initial supply. developed theoretical models synonymously redundant representations show population size solve problem number generations O(2kr/r), kr order redundancy number genotypic building blocks (BB) represent optimal phenotypic BB. result, uniformly redundant representations change behavior GAs. increasing r, means overrepresenting optimal solution, GA performance increase.

However, generally speaking, information contained sequence observations appeared, ignored-i.e., dependence information case Markov models n-gram statistics. paper, present results which, knowledge, reported results, estimation enhanced utilizing information observations sequence appearance. strategy, sequence based estimation (SBE) works follows. quickly allude results pertaining computing maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) data samples individually. derive MLE results samples two-at-a-time, extend cases processed three-at-a-time, four-at-a-time etc. case, experimentally demonstrate convergence estimates. suggest avenues future research, including estimates fused yield superior cumulative estimate parameter distribution, pattern recognition (PR), internet compression applications. estimates great potential practitioners, cardinality observation set small.

#ABSTRACT peer-to-peer (P2P) system, multiple peer processes issue transactions manipulate objects. transaction issued process assigned subfamily roles named purpose, granted process. transaction reads object o1 writes object o2, information o1 flow o2. Suppose transaction T1 purpose R1 precedes transaction T2 purpose R2 schedule. Here, legal information flow relation R1 => R2 holds, illegal information flow occur. Otherwise, illegal information flow occur. order prevent illegal information flow, T1 writes object o, object marked purpose R1. transaction T2 allowed read object R1 => R2. T1 commits, object isstill marked purpose R1. Hence, transaction T3 purpose R3 R1 legally flow R3 aborted T3 reads object o. result, throughput degraded. paper, discuss release purpose marks objects. Objects information flow object source objects o. source objects changed, purpose mark object released. addition, object lifetime o's data secure data iscreated. takes time object marked, purpose mark released. occur illegal information flow purpose marking (PM) protocol, transactions imply illegal information flow aborted. evaluate PM protocol terms transactions aborted.

Previously proposed approaches LPM result prohibitive cost power dissipation (TCAMs) large memory requirements long lookup latencies (tries), future line-rates, table sizes key lengths (e.g., IPv6). Hash-based approaches excellent candidate LPM possibility low power, compact storage, O(1) latencies. However, key problems hinder practical deployment LPM solutions. First, naïve hash tables incur collisions resolve chaining, adversely affecting worst-case lookup-rate guarantees routers provide. Second, hash functions directly operate wildcard bits, requirement LPM, current solutions require considerably complex hardware large storage space. paper propose architecture successfully addresses time, key problems hash based LPM  making contributions: (1) architect LPM solution based recently-proposed, collision-free hashing scheme called Bloomier filter, eliminating false positives storage efficient way. (2) propose scheme called prefix collapsing, support wildcard bits small additional storage reduced hardware complexity. (3) exploit prefix collapsing key characteristics found real update traces support fast incremental updates, feature generally collision-free hashing schemes.

Subsequent work developed hardware-based on-line mechanism averages 75--85% energy-delay improvement achieved off-line analysis.In paper automatic insertion reconfiguration instructions applications, profile-driven binary rewriting. Profile-based reconfiguration introduces "training runs" prior production application, avoids hardware complexity on-line reconfiguration. potential yield significantly greater energy savings.

#ABSTRACT Eric Tsang's response makes legitimate point prediction explanation goals. However, arguments suffer errors logic, converse error. claim unrealistic assumptions breed good theories. claim breakthrough theories assumptions deemed unrealistic. Hence, unrealistic assumptions breed good bad theories. science tests theories, assumptions. Moreover, easily prove realistic assumptions required. situations competing theories correct. example, criminal cases, prosecution's theory accused committed crime. defense's theory accused innocent. theory correct fact make unrealistic assumptions. example, prosecution unrealistically assume unreliable eyewitness testimony sufficient convict. defense unrealistically assume dubious alibi sufficient acquit. Juries decide evidence assumption. answer Eric Tsang's questions.

#ABSTRACT Motivation: Statistical assessment cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) crucial task computational biology. Usually, concludes exceptional co-occurrences DNA motifs transcription factors (TFs) cooperative. However, similar DNA motifs tend co-occur random sequences due high probability overlapping occurrences. Therefore, important similarity DNA motifs statistical assessment. Results: Based previous work, propose adjust window size co-occurrence detection. derived approximation, obtains window sizes sets DNA motifs depending similarities. ensures probability co-occurrences random sequences equal. Applying approach selected similar dissimilar DNA motifs human TFs shows necessity adjustment confirms accuracy approximation comparison simulated data. Furthermore, clear approaches ignoring similarities strongly underestimate P-values cooperativity TFs similar DNA motifs. addition, approach extended deal overlapping windows. derive Chen–Stein error bounds approximation. Comparing error bounds similar dissimilar DNA motifs shows approximation similar DNA motifs yields large bounds. Hence, careful overlapping windows. Based error bounds, precompute approximation errors select overlap scheme running analysis.

Analysis realistic processor workloads shows preponderance bubbles persist pipelines floating point unit. Clock scheduling ostensibly adapts pipeline depth respect bubbles instruction stream performance loss. Unfortunately, shallower pipelines (i.e. longer pipe stages) prone larger amounts glitches propagating logic, increasing dynamic power. Experimentally measured results 130nm FPU test chip flexible clocking capabilities show super-linear increase glitch-induced dynamic power shallower pipelines. higher glitch power severely diminish power savings offered clock scheduling, judicious clocking intermediate stages offers glitch mitigation recover power savings worst-case scenarios.

Commonly, spatial K-anonymity employed hide query initiator group users. However, existing work fails guarantee privacy, exhibits unacceptably long response time. paper propose MobiHide, Peer-to-Peer system anonymous location-based queries, addresses problems. MobiHide employs Hilbert space-filling curve map 2-D locations mobile users 1-D space. transformed locations indexed Chord-based distributed hash table, formed mobile devices. resulting Peer-to-Peer system anonymize query mapping random group users consecutive 1-D space. Compared existing state-of-the-art, MobiHide provide theoretical anonymity guarantees skewed query distributions. Nevertheless, achieves strong anonymity practice, eliminates system hotspots. experimental evaluation shows MobiHide good load balancing fault tolerance properties, applicable real-life scenarios numerous mobile users.

#ABSTRACT Wormhole networks traditionally deadlock avoidance strategies. recently, deadlock recovery strategies begun gain acceptance. particular, progressive deadlock recovery techniques allocate dedicated resources quickly deliver deadlocked packets. Deadlock recovery based assumption deadlocks rare; otherwise, recovery techniques efficient. Measurements deadlock occurrence frequency show deadlocks highly routing freedom provided [36], [32]. However, networks prone deadlocks network close saturation, causing network performance degradation. Similar performance degradation behavior saturation observed networks deadlock avoidance strategies [13]. paper, approach handling deadlocks performance degradation. propose injection limitation mechanism prevents performance degradation saturation point and, time, reduces probability deadlock negligible values. propose improved deadlock detection mechanism local information, detects deadlocks, considerably reduces probability false deadlock detection previous proposals. rare case impending deadlock detected, proposal consists simple recovery technique absorbs deadlocked message current node reinjects continued routing destination. Performance evaluation results show approach handling deadlock efficient previously proposed techniques.

#ABSTRACT initiate class string matching problems called Substring Compression Problems. string preprocessed, problem quickly find compressed representation compressed size query substring (Substring Compression Query SCQ) find length substring compression (Least Compressible Substring LCS problem).Starting seminal paper Lempel Ziv 25 years ago, methods emerged compressing entire strings. Determining substring compressibility natural variant combinatorially algorithmically challenging, surprisingly studied before. addition, compressibility strings emerging tool compare biological sequences analyze information content. However, typically, compressibility entire sequence informative portions sequences. substring compressibility suitable basis sequence analysis.We present known, optimal algorithms substring compression problems---SCQ, LCS generalizations---that exact provably approximate. exact algorithms exploit structure strings suffix trees approximate algorithms rely relationships find Lempel-Ziv compression string parsings.
